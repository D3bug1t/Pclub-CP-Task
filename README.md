# Pclub-CP-Task
# A.	Race Against Time!
Sanskaar and Anaswar are participating in the on-site round of ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). The problem-set consists of N questions and each problem takes ai time to be solved by both of them (Assume they both are equally capable of solving all the problems in the same time).
But here’s the catch! Since Sanskaar and Anaswar were late to the on-site round. They have only X minutes left to solve all the questions. In order to do so, they devise a plan to split problems between them so that they can complete all the problems. Since they don’t have time to optimally split problems between themselves they ask for you help. Can you split the problems in such a way that the time taken by them to solve all the problems is minimum?
# Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers N and X -number of questions in the problem-set and time left to solve all the questions.
The second line contains N space separated integers which denotes the time taken by Sanskaar and Anaswar to solve a problem.
# Output Format
The output shall contain 1 integer-Minimum time to complete all the problems.
If it is not possible to complete all the problems in leftover time output -1.
# Constraints
1≤T≤10
1≤N≤100
1≤X≤10000
1≤ai≤1000
